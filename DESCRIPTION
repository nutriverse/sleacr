Description: In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through 
    two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition assessment 
    or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric Systematic Area 
    Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource intensive and often only 
    used for final programme evaluation meaning results arrive too late for 
    programme adaptation. SLEAC, which stands for Simplified Lot Quality 
    Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage, is a low resource 
    method designed specifically to address this limitation and is used 
    regularly for monitoring, planning and importantly, timely improvement to 
    programme quality, both for agency and Ministry of Health (MoH) led 
    programmes. SLEAC is designed to complement the Semi-quantitative Evaluation 
    of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC) method. This package provides functions for 
    use in conducting a SLEAC assessment.
