Description: In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through
    two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition assessment
    or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric Systematic Area
    Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource intensive and often only
    used for final programme evaluation meaning results arrive too late for
    programme adaptation. SLEAC, which stands for Simplified Lot Quality
    Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage, is a low resource
    method designed specifically to address this limitation and is used
    regularly for monitoring, planning and importantly, timely improvement to
    programme quality, both for agency and Ministry of Health (MoH) led
    programmes. SLEAC is designed to complement the Semi-quantitative Evaluation
    of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC) method. This package provides functions for
    use in conducting a SLEAC assessment.
