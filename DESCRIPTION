Description: In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through 
    two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition assessment 
    or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric Systematic Area 
    Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource intensive and often only 
    used for final programme evaluation meaning results arrive too late for 
    programme adaptation. SLEAC, which stands for Simplified Lot Quality Assurance 
    Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage, is a low resource method designed 
    specifically to address this limitation and is used regularly for monitoring, 
    planning and importantly, timely improvement to programme quality, both for 
    agency and Ministry of Health (MoH) led programmes. SLEAC is designed to
    complement the Semi-quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC)
    method. This package provides functions for use in conducting a SLEAC 
    assessment.
