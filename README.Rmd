In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition assessment or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource intensive and often only used for final programme evaluation meaning results arrive too late for programme adaptation. SLEAC, which stands for Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage, is a low resource method designed specifically to address this limitation and is used regularly for monitoring, planning and importantly, timely improvement to programme quality, both for agency and Ministry of Health (MoH) led programmes. This package provides functions for use in conducting a SLEAC assessment.

## What does the package do?

The `{sleacr}` package provides functions that facilitate the design, sampling, data collection, and data analysis of a SLEAC survey. The current version of the `{sleacr}` package currently provides the following:

* Functions to calculate the sample size needed for a SLEAC survey;

* Functions to draw a stage 1 sample for a SLEAC survey;

* Functions to determine the performance of chosen classifier cut-offs for analysis of SLEAC survey data.

## Installation

The `{sleacr}` package is not yet available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) but can be installed from the [nutriverse R Universe](https://nutriverse.r-universe.dev) as follows:

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "sleacr",
  repos = c('https://nutriverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

## Citation

If you use `{sleacr}` in your work, please cite using the suggested citation provided by a call to the `citation` function as follows:

```{r cite}
citation("sleacr")
```
