In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through
two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition
assessment or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric
Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource
intensive and often only used for final programme evaluation meaning
results arrive too late for programme adaptation. SLEAC, which stands
for Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and
Coverage, is a low resource method designed specifically to address this
limitation and is used regularly for monitoring, planning and
importantly, timely improvement to programme quality, both for agency
and Ministry of Health (MoH) led programmes. This package provides
functions for use in conducting a SLEAC assessment.

## Installation

The `sleacr` package is not yet available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) but can be installed from the
[nutriverse R Universe](https://nutriverse.r-universe.dev) as follows:

``` r
install.packages(
  "sleacr",
  repos = c('https://nutriverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

## What does `sleacr` do?

The `sleacr` package provides functions that facilitate the design,
sampling, data collection, and data analysis of a SLEAC survey. The
current version of the `sleacr` package currently provides the
following:

  - Functions to calculate the sample size needed for a SLEAC survey;

  - Functions to draw a stage 1 sample for a SLEAC survey;

  - Functions to determine the performance of chosen classifier cut-offs
    for analysis of SLEAC survey data.
